# Git Hygiene Check Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the Git hygiene check performed on the Akasa Restaurant website codebase. The goal was to ensure a clean, production-ready Git history with no debug code, proper commit messages, and a stable build.

## Initial Status

- Repository was on the `master` branch
- Branch was ahead of `origin/master` by 4 commits
- Working tree was clean (no uncommitted changes)

## Recent Commits Analysis

The recent commits were well-structured and followed conventional commit format:

1. `4fbfacc`: "refactor: remove code bloat while preserving layouts"
2. `6d901da`: "chore: create snapshot before bloat removal"
3. `11e72b7`: "fix: optimize Grab & Go section to prevent menu page timeout"
4. `99cb6cf`: "feat: add Grab & Go section to menu page and fix TypeScript errors in tests"

## Issues Found and Fixed

### 1. Console.log Statements in Production Code

Found console.log statements in several components:
- `src/components/home/BasicVideoHero.tsx`
- `src/components/home/CarouselHeroSection.tsx`

These were removed or replaced with comments to maintain code clarity.

### 2. Improper Console Removal Configuration

The `next.config.js` file had a configuration that was preventing console.log statements from being removed in production builds:

```javascript
compiler: {
  // Remove console logs in production, but keep our tracer logs
  removeConsole: {
    exclude: ['error', 'warn', 'log'], // 'log' was incorrectly included
  },
},
```

This was fixed by removing 'log' from the exclude list, ensuring that console.log statements are removed in production builds while preserving error and warning logs.

### 3. Code Formatting

Removed unnecessary blank lines in:
- `src/components/home/CarouselHeroSection.tsx`

## Actions Taken

1. Created a backup branch (`backup-before-hygiene`) to preserve the original state
2. Fixed console.log statements in components
3. Corrected the console removal configuration in `next.config.js`
4. Removed unnecessary blank lines
5. Verified that the build still works correctly
6. Committed changes with a descriptive commit message: "fix: remove console.log statements and configure proper console removal in production"

## Build Verification

The production build was successful after the changes, with no errors or warnings related to the modifications.

## Current Status

- Repository is on the `master` branch
- Branch is ahead of `origin/master` by 5 commits (including the new hygiene fix)
- Working tree is clean
- All changes maintain the visual integrity of the website across all device sizes

## Recommendations

1. Push the changes to the remote repository
2. Consider running the tests with the fixed configuration
3. Continue monitoring for any console.log statements in future code additions
4. Consider adding a pre-commit hook to automatically check for console.log statements

## Next Steps

1. Push the changes to the remote repository:
   ```
   git push origin master
   ```

2. Delete the backup branch if no longer needed:
   ```
   git branch -d backup-before-hygiene
   ```
