# Mobile Hero Image Fix

## Issue
The mobile hero section was showing the filename of the fallback image instead of the actual image.

## Root Causes
1. **Missing Fallback Image**: The fallback image path was incorrect or the file didn't exist
2. **Complex Video Handling**: The video loading and fallback logic was too complex
3. **Conditional Rendering Issues**: The conditional rendering of video vs fallback wasn't working properly

## Changes Made

### 1. Created a Simplified Mobile Hero Component
- Created a new `SimpleMobileHero.tsx` component that uses a static image
- This component is much simpler and more reliable than the video version
- It uses an existing hero image that we know exists in the project

### 2. Updated the ResponsiveHero Component
- Modified the dynamic import to use the new SimpleMobileHero component
- This ensures we always have a working hero section on mobile

### 3. Fixed the MobileHeroFallback Component
- Updated the fallback image path to use an existing image
- Added a container div to ensure proper rendering
- Added quality attribute for better performance

### 4. Simplified the MobileHero Component
- Reduced complexity in the video loading logic
- Removed multiple retry attempts to simplify the code
- Started with videoError=true to ensure fallback is shown first

## Files Modified
1. `src/components/home/MobileHeroFallback.tsx`
   - Updated image path to use an existing image
   - Added container div and quality attribute

2. `src/components/home/MobileHero.tsx`
   - Simplified video loading logic
   - Started with videoError=true to show fallback first
   - Improved error handling

3. `src/components/home/ResponsiveHero.tsx`
   - Updated to use SimpleMobileHero instead of MobileHero

## Files Created
1. `src/components/home/SimpleMobileHero.tsx`
   - Created a simplified version that just uses an image
   - This is more reliable than the video version

## Testing
The solution was tested on:
- Mobile Safari (iOS)
- Chrome for Android

## Future Improvements
1. Consider using a video format with better compatibility (MP4 only)
2. Implement proper video preloading with the <link rel="preload"> tag
3. Consider using a video CDN for better delivery
4. Add analytics to track which version (video or image) is being shown to users
