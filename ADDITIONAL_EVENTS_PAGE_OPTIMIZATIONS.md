# Additional Events Page Performance Optimizations

This document outlines the additional performance optimizations made to address the remaining lag on the Events page.

## 1. Background and Blur Effect Optimizations

### TestimonialsSection Component
- **Replaced Background Image with Gradient**: Changed from a heavy background image to a simple gradient background
- **Removed Backdrop Blur**: Eliminated `backdrop-blur-sm` effect from testimonial cards
- **Increased Background Opacity**: Changed from `bg-black/80` to `bg-black/90` for better performance while maintaining visual appearance

### InquiryFormSection Component
- **Replaced Background Image with Gradient**: Changed from a heavy background image to a simple gradient background
- **Removed Backdrop Blur**: Eliminated `backdrop-blur-sm` effect from the form container
- **Increased Background Opacity**: Changed from `bg-black/70` to `bg-black/90` for better performance

## 2. Scroll Behavior Optimizations

### ScrollBehavior Component
- **Limited Hardware Acceleration**: Restricted `transform: translateZ(0)` to only critical elements (mobile navigation and floating action buttons)
- **Removed Unnecessary will-change Properties**: Eliminated `will-change: transform` which can cause performance issues when overused
- **Removed content-visibility**: Eliminated `content-visibility: auto` which can cause layout issues

## 3. Lazy Loading with Intersection Observer

### Dynamic Import Optimizations
- **Added SSR: false Option**: Disabled server-side rendering for below-the-fold components to improve initial page load
- **Implemented Intersection Observer**: Added intersection observer to load components only when they're about to enter the viewport
- **Conditional Rendering**: Components are only rendered when they become visible in the viewport
- **Optimized Observer Options**: Set appropriate rootMargin and threshold values for smooth loading

### Implementation Details
- Added refs for the testimonials and inquiry form sections
- Created state variables to track visibility
- Set up intersection observers with appropriate options
- Disconnected observers after components become visible to free up resources

## 4. Memory and Resource Management

- **Cleanup on Unmount**: Added proper cleanup for intersection observers
- **Reduced DOM Manipulation**: Minimized unnecessary DOM operations
- **Optimized Animation Playback**: Ensured animations only run when needed

## 5. Mobile-Specific Optimizations

- **Simplified Background Elements**: Replaced complex backgrounds with simpler alternatives that perform better on mobile
- **Reduced Visual Effects**: Eliminated unnecessary visual effects that can cause lag on mobile devices
- **Touch Action Optimization**: Maintained touch-action: manipulation for better touch response

## Results

These additional optimizations should significantly reduce the lag on the Events page by:

1. Eliminating expensive backdrop-blur effects
2. Reducing the number of elements with hardware acceleration
3. Loading components only when needed using intersection observer
4. Simplifying background elements and animations

The visual design remains largely intact, with the performance improvements being mostly transparent to users except for the improved speed and responsiveness.

## Next Steps

If lag persists, consider:

1. Further reducing animation complexity
2. Implementing virtualization for long lists
3. Breaking the page into smaller, more manageable chunks
4. Adding debounce/throttle to scroll events
5. Profiling with Chrome DevTools to identify specific bottlenecks
