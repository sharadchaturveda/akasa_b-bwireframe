# Inquiry Section Fix

This document explains the changes made to fix the missing inquiry section on the Events page.

## Issue

The inquiry section was not appearing on the Events page after implementing the intersection observer-based lazy loading. This was likely due to one of the following issues:

1. The intersection observer was not properly detecting when the inquiry section entered the viewport
2. The container div with `min-height` was preventing the actual content from rendering
3. The dynamic import with `ssr: false` was causing issues with component loading

## Solution

To fix the issue, we simplified the approach by:

1. **Removing Dynamic Imports**: Changed from dynamic imports to direct imports to ensure components are always available
   ```javascript
   // Before
   const InquiryFormSection = dynamic(() => import("@/components/events/InquiryFormSection"), {
     loading: () => <div className="h-[50vh] bg-black"></div>,
     ssr: false
   });
   
   // After
   import InquiryFormSection from "@/components/events/InquiryFormSection";
   ```

2. **Removing Intersection Observer Logic**: Eliminated the intersection observer implementation that was conditionally rendering components
   ```javascript
   // Before
   useEffect(() => {
     if (!testimonialsRef.current || !inquiryFormRef.current) return;
     
     const observerOptions = {
       root: null,
       rootMargin: '100px',
       threshold: 0.1
     };
     
     // Observer setup and logic...
   }, []);
   
   // After
   // No intersection observer logic
   ```

3. **Simplifying Component Rendering**: Directly rendered the components without conditional logic
   ```javascript
   // Before
   <div ref={inquiryFormRef}>
     {inquiryFormVisible && <InquiryFormSection />}
   </div>
   
   // After
   <InquiryFormSection />
   ```

4. **Removing State Variables**: Eliminated the state variables used to track component visibility
   ```javascript
   // Before
   const [testimonialsVisible, setTestimonialsVisible] = useState(false);
   const [inquiryFormVisible, setInquiryFormVisible] = useState(false);
   
   // After
   // No visibility state variables
   ```

## Performance Considerations

While we've removed the intersection observer-based lazy loading for now, we've maintained other performance optimizations:

1. The background image in the InquiryFormSection has been replaced with a simple gradient
2. The backdrop-blur effect has been removed from the form container
3. The background opacity has been increased for better performance

## Next Steps

Once the basic functionality is working correctly, we can consider re-implementing a more robust lazy loading solution:

1. Use a more reliable intersection observer implementation
2. Consider using React's built-in lazy and Suspense features
3. Implement proper loading states that don't interfere with layout
4. Test thoroughly across different devices and browsers

For now, the priority was to ensure the inquiry section appears correctly while maintaining the performance improvements from our other optimizations.
