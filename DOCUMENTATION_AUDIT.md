# Documentation Audit Report

## Documentation to Keep

1. **README.md Structure**
   - The overall structure of the README.md is well-organized and comprehensive
   - The table of contents is clear and covers all major aspects of the project
   - The project overview and key features are concise and informative

2. **Mobile-First Design Documentation**
   - Documentation about mobile-first design principles is valuable and should be preserved
   - Specific mobile optimizations and considerations are well-documented
   - Mobile-specific components and their purposes are clearly explained

3. **Project Structure Documentation**
   - The directory structure overview is clear and helpful
   - The explanation of each directory's purpose is concise

4. **Component Documentation Templates**
   - The component documentation templates provide good guidelines for future documentation
   - JSDoc comment templates are well-structured and comprehensive

5. **Hook Documentation**
   - Documentation about custom hooks is valuable, especially for the device detection hook
   - Usage examples are helpful for understanding how to use the hooks

## Documentation to Rewrite



2. **Deployment Section**
   - The deployment section is too generic and could be more specific to the project
   - Should include more details about the GitHub â†’ Vercel pipeline and master-only flow

3. **Technology Stack**
   - Could be more comprehensive with version numbers and links to documentation
   - Should include more details about how each technology is used in the project

4. **Getting Started Section**
   - Installation instructions could be more detailed
   - Should include information about environment variables (without secrets)

5. **Known Issues and Future Work**
   - Should be updated to reflect the current state of the project
   - Some items may be outdated or already implemented

## Documentation to Remove

1. **Redundant Documentation Files**
   - DOCUMENTATION_SUMMARY.md contains information that is already in README.md
   - DOCUMENTATION_CLEANUP_REPORT.md is a meta-document about documentation changes

2. **Outdated Component Documentation**
   - Documentation for deprecated components or utilities should be removed or marked with // REVIEW:

3. **Redundant Inline Comments**
   - Comments that simply restate what the code does without adding context
   - Comments that are outdated or no longer accurate

4. **Duplicate Documentation**
   - Information that is repeated across multiple files
   - Documentation that exists in both README.md and DOCUMENTATION.md

## Risky Removals (Mark with // REVIEW:)

1. **Deprecated Utilities**
   - `useDisableOptimizations` hook is marked as deprecated but might still be referenced
   - `disableDiningInfoDebug` function is deprecated but might still be used

2. **Legacy Components**
   - ReservationInfo component has legacy code that might still be in use
   - References to optimization exclusions for specific components

3. **Mobile-Specific CSS**
   - Some mobile-specific CSS might still be needed even if it seems redundant

## Conclusion

The documentation is generally well-structured but contains some outdated information and redundancy. The new README.md should focus on providing a clear, concise overview of the project while removing outdated information and reducing redundancy. The documentation should be tailored for a junior or mid-level developer who is seeing the project for the first time.
