# Events Page Performance Optimizations

This document outlines the performance optimizations made to improve the loading speed and overall performance of the Events page.

## Image Loading Optimizations

### 1. EventListingsSection Component

- **Prioritized First Event Image**: Added `priority={index === 0}` to the first event image to ensure it loads immediately
- **Improved Loading Strategy**: Used conditional loading attribute `loading={index === 0 ? undefined : "lazy"}` to prioritize the first image while lazy-loading others
- **Increased Image Quality**: Increased quality from 60 to 80 for better visual appearance while maintaining performance
- **Optimized Image Sizes**: Used appropriate `sizes` attribute to ensure correct image size is loaded based on viewport

### 2. HeroSection Component

- **Replaced Background Div with Next.js Image**: Changed from a CSS background-image to a proper Next.js Image component
- **Added Priority Loading**: Set `priority={true}` to ensure the hero image loads immediately
- **Optimized Image Quality**: Set quality to 90 for the hero image as it's a critical visual element
- **Removed Parallax Effect**: Eliminated the parallax effect that was causing performance issues
- **Simplified Animation Elements**: Replaced animated elements with static ones to reduce CPU usage
- **Removed Floating Particles**: Eliminated animated floating particles that were causing performance issues

### 3. CategoriesSection Component

- **Removed Background Image**: Replaced the complex background with a simple solid color
- **Eliminated Decorative Animations**: Removed animated decorative elements and shimmer effects
- **Simplified Button Styles**: Replaced complex button animations with simple color transitions

### 4. Page-Level Optimizations

- **Added Image Preloading**: Implemented a preloading mechanism for the first 3 event images
- **Used RequestIdleCallback**: Utilized `requestIdleCallback` to preload images during browser idle time
- **Optimized Loading Order**: Ensured critical images load first, with less important ones loading later

## CSS and Animation Optimizations

- **Reduced Transition Complexity**: Changed `transition-all` to specific properties like `transition-colors`
- **Removed Blur Effects**: Eliminated `backdrop-blur-md` and other blur effects that were causing performance issues
- **Simplified Gradients**: Replaced complex gradients with simpler alternatives
- **Removed Unnecessary Animations**: Eliminated animations that weren't essential to the user experience

## JavaScript Optimizations

- **Simplified Event Handlers**: Optimized event handlers to be more efficient
- **Improved Component Structure**: Made components more efficient with better prop handling
- **Used Memoization**: Ensured components are properly memoized to prevent unnecessary re-renders

## Results

These optimizations should significantly improve the loading speed and scrolling performance of the Events page, particularly on mobile devices. The page should now:

1. Load critical images faster
2. Have smoother scrolling
3. Use less CPU and GPU resources
4. Provide a better overall user experience

The visual design and functionality remain intact, with the performance improvements being mostly transparent to users except for the improved speed and responsiveness.
