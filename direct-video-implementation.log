# Direct Video Implementation

## Issue
The mobile hero video wasn't playing despite multiple attempts to fix it through component-based approaches.

## Root Causes
1. **Component Complexity**: The previous implementations had too many layers of abstraction
2. **Dynamic Imports**: The dynamic imports might have interfered with video initialization
3. **Conditional Rendering**: Complex conditional rendering might have prevented proper video loading

## Solution
Implemented a direct, inline video element in the page.tsx file with minimal abstraction:

1. **Direct HTML Video Element**: Added a video element directly in the page component
2. **Simplified Attributes**: Used only essential video attributes (muted, playsInline, loop, autoPlay)
3. **Direct Source**: Used the src attribute instead of source elements
4. **Fallback Image**: Maintained a fallback image that's always visible behind the video
5. **Mobile-Only**: Used responsive classes to only show this on mobile devices

## Files Modified
1. `src/app/page.tsx`
   - Added direct video element with minimal abstraction
   - Added responsive classes to show different heroes on mobile vs desktop
   - Added Image import for the fallback image

2. `src/components/home/BasicVideoHero.tsx`
   - Created a simplified video hero component
   - Used direct src attribute instead of source elements
   - Added explicit styling for video element

3. `src/components/home/ResponsiveHero.tsx`
   - Simplified the responsive logic
   - Removed page reload on resize
   - Used direct import for BasicVideoHero

## Key Changes
1. **Simplified Video Element**:
   ```jsx
   <video
     className="absolute inset-0 w-full h-full z-10"
     muted
     playsInline
     loop
     autoPlay
     preload="auto"
     src="/images/home/hero/mobile-video/heromobilevid.mp4"
     style={{
       objectFit: 'cover',
       width: '100%',
       height: '100%'
     }}
   ></video>
   ```

2. **Direct Implementation in Page**:
   - Added the video element directly in page.tsx
   - Used responsive classes to control visibility
   - Maintained the existing component for desktop

## Testing
The solution was tested on:
- Mobile Safari (iOS)
- Chrome for Android

## Future Improvements
1. Consider using a more efficient video format
2. Implement proper video preloading
3. Add analytics to track video playback success
4. Consider using a video CDN for better delivery
