# Mobile Hero Video Fix

## Issue
The mobile hero section's video wasn't playing after performance optimizations were made.

## Root Causes
1. **WebM Format Compatibility**: Some mobile browsers don't support WebM format
2. **Video Loading Strategy**: Lack of proper fallback mechanism when video fails to load
3. **Video Preloading**: No preloading strategy for the video
4. **Error Handling**: No proper error handling for video playback failures

## Changes Made

### 1. Added MP4 Fallback Format
- Added MP4 source as a fallback for browsers that don't support WebM
- Browsers will now try WebM first, then fall back to MP4 if needed

### 2. Improved Video Loading Strategy
- Added state tracking for video loading status (`videoLoaded` and `videoError`)
- Implemented proper visibility toggling based on loading state
- Created a dedicated fallback component that shows when video fails to load

### 3. Added Video Preloading
- Created a new utility (`videoPreload.ts`) for preloading videos
- Implemented link preloading for both WebM and MP4 formats
- Added early preloading in the ResponsiveHero component

### 4. Enhanced Error Handling
- Added retry logic with multiple attempts to play the video
- Added proper error state management
- Implemented graceful fallback to static image when video fails

### 5. Improved Video Element Configuration
- Added explicit styling to ensure proper video display
- Added all necessary attributes for mobile playback (playsinline, etc.)
- Forced video visibility through inline styles

## Files Modified
1. `src/components/home/MobileHero.tsx`
   - Added MP4 fallback source
   - Implemented loading state management
   - Added error handling and retry logic
   - Added fallback component integration

2. `src/components/home/ResponsiveHero.tsx`
   - Added video preloading on initial load
   - Improved device detection logic

## Files Created
1. `src/utils/videoPreload.ts`
   - Added utilities for preloading videos
   - Implemented multiple preloading strategies

2. `src/components/home/MobileHeroFallback.tsx`
   - Created fallback component with static image
   - Maintained the same text content as the video version

## Testing
The solution was tested on:
- Mobile Safari (iOS)
- Chrome for Android
- Mobile Edge

## Future Improvements
1. Consider converting the video to more efficient formats (AV1)
2. Implement adaptive bitrate streaming for different network conditions
3. Add analytics to track video loading success/failure rates
4. Consider using the Picture-in-Picture API for better video handling
