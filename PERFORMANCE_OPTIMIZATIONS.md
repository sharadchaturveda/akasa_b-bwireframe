# Performance Optimizations for Akasa Restaurant Website

This document outlines the performance optimizations made to improve the website's loading speed, scrolling performance, and overall user experience.

## 1. Image Optimizations

### Next.js Image Configuration
- Enabled Next.js built-in image optimization by setting `unoptimized: false` in `next.config.js`
- Reduced default image quality to 60% for better performance
- Added proper `sizes` attributes to all images for responsive loading
- Used `priority` attribute only for above-the-fold images
- Added `loading="lazy"` for all below-the-fold images

### Image Component Replacements
- Replaced regular `<img>` tags with Next.js `Image` components in:
  - EventListingsSection
  - Other components using background images

## 2. CSS Performance Improvements

### Removed Heavy CSS Effects
- Removed `backdrop-blur` effects from:
  - MobileMenuOverlay
  - TestimonialCard
  - MenuItemCard components
  - DrinkMenuItemCard
  - BarBiteMenuItemCard

### Optimized Transitions
- Replaced `transition-all` with specific transitions:
  - Changed to `transition-colors` or `transition-opacity` where appropriate
  - Reduced transition durations from 700-1000ms to 300-500ms
  - Removed unnecessary hover animations

### Scroll Performance
- Optimized `scroll-performance.css`:
  - Limited hardware acceleration to critical elements only
  - Removed unnecessary `will-change` properties
  - Simplified animation classes
  - Removed content-visibility which was causing issues

## 3. JavaScript Optimizations

- Limited font weights to only those needed
- Removed unused font variables from body class

### Preload Optimizations
- Removed unnecessary font preloading
- Added fetchpriority="high" to critical resources

## 5. Background and Decorative Elements

### Static Elements
- Replaced animated particles with static elements
- Removed animated background patterns
- Simplified decorative corner accents

### Gradient Effects
- Replaced complex gradients with simpler alternatives
- Removed text gradients in favor of solid colors

## 6. Button Optimizations

### Simplified Buttons

- Optimized mobile-specific button rendering

## Next Steps

1. Monitor Core Web Vitals after these changes
2. Consider further optimizations for specific pages if needed
3. Implement responsive image loading based on device capabilities
4. Consider implementing priority hints for critical resources
